## You Rock!

Congrats and building and deploying your app!

Come see what other people are up to.

- The [NodeAZ Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/NodeAZ/) is a great place to see some mind-blowing stuff being created with Node. It's also a great spot to catch some of the prolific Node developers in the valley.
- The [Phoenix Javascript Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Phoenix-JavaScript/) isn't focused on Node, but as the name suggestions, it's all about Javascript. It usually covers frontend JS, but Node topics are commonly brought up as well.
- The [Arizona Software Community Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/azsoftcom/) may not be Node or JS specific, but they come up often, and there's a lot of other great talks here too.
- [BeerJS PHX](http://www.meetup.com/beerjs-PHX/) is also a great spot to meet other local JS developers, and grab a drink while you're at it.
