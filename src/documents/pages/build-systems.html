<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>You have tasks you need to run constantly. Even a simple project might need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Use a css pre-processor </li>
  <li> Concat and minify JS </li>
  <li> Pre-compile front-end templates </li>
  <li> Transpile coffeescript </li>
</ul>

<p>You probably also want to <a href="http://jslint.com/">lint</a> your code and maybe even run some tests.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Use a build processes. This is a program, usually written in Node, that will perform all these tasks for you automatically. You set it up once and never worry about those steps again.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> - "The Streaming Build System" is the next generation, and it's made right here in Phoenix</li>
  <li><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> - "The Javascript Task Runner" has been around for a while, and you'll come across it for sure</li>
</ul>

<p>There are others, but Gulp is easy and very fast, has a thriving community and it's being used practically everywhere now.</p>

<h3>Gulp</h3>

<h4>Gulpfile.js</h4>

<p>Gulp uses a Gulpfile to define your build process. It's just Node, and here's an example.</p>

<div>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">
// gulpfile.js

var gulp = require('gulp');

var lint   = require('gulp-coffeelint');
var coffee = require('gulp-coffee');
var concat = require('gulp-concat');
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');

var paths = {
  scripts: ['client/js/**/*.coffee', '!client/external/**/*.coffee']
};

// Compile coffeescript then minify, concat and save it
gulp.task('scripts', function() {
  // Minify and copy all JavaScript (except vendor scripts)
  return gulp.src(paths.scripts)
    .pipe(lint())
    .pipe(coffee())
    .pipe(uglify())
    .pipe(concat('all.min.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('build/js'));
});

// Rerun the task when a file changes
gulp.task('watch', function() {
  gulp.watch(paths.scripts, ['scripts']);
});

// The default task (called when you run `gulp` from cli)
gulp.task('default', ['scripts', 'watch']);
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Execution</h4>

<pre><code class="lang-bash">
$ gulp
</code></pre>

Runs the <code>default</code> task, which in the example above, runs the <code>scripts</code> and <code>watch</code> tasks.
